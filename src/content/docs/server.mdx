description: "Go server with WebSocket communication and user management"
---

The Relay Server is a backend application built with Go, providing real-time communication capabilities, user management, and file handling. It serves as the central hub for Relay client connections and manages channels, messages, voice communication, and user permissions.

## Overview

Built with Go, the Relay Server handles multiple concurrent connections while maintaining message delivery and voice communication. It features a REST API alongside WebSocket connections.

## Key Features

### High Performance

-   Written in Go for concurrency support
-   WebSocket handling for real-time communication
-   Database queries with GORM
-   Connection pooling and resource management

### Real-time Communication

-   WebSocket-based message delivery
-   Voice channel management
-   User presence and typing indicators
-   Message reactions and status updates

### Data Management

-   SQLite database with migrations
-   Message storage and retrieval
-   File upload and management system
-   User data storage

### User & Permission Management

-   Role-based access control (RBAC)
-   Server registration system
-   User authentication
-   Channel permissions and moderation tools

### Security

-   Ed25519 cryptographic authentication
-   File upload validation
-   Rate limiting and protection
-   HTTPS/WSS encryption for communications

## Architecture

The Relay Server is built using Go technologies:

-   **Go**: Backend language
-   **Gin**: HTTP web framework
-   **GORM**: ORM for database operations
-   **SQLite**: Embedded database
-   **Gorilla WebSocket**: WebSocket implementation
-   **JWT**: JSON Web Tokens for authentication

## Database Schema

The server uses a database schema to manage:

-   **Users**: Authentication, profiles, and preferences
-   **Servers**: Multi-server support with settings
-   **Channels**: Text and voice channels with permissions
-   **Messages**: Message storage with metadata
-   **Files**: File storage and access control
-   **Roles**: Permission-based user roles and capabilities

## Deployment Options

### Available Deployment Methods

-   **[Quick Start](/docs/server/getting-started)**: Get your server running locally
